Our color palette is inspired by the blackboard, which is a dark green color. The profile page designs has lighter green hue for background. We also have orange and blue tones throughout the website, which are reflected in colors of some buttons and text.

2. Contrast of landing page changed to have the background in a darker gradient to allow the text to pop more
   original:
